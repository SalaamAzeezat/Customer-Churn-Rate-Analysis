## 📌 Project Goal
Customer churn is a significant challenge for subscription-based businesses. The aim of this project is to analyse customer churn data to identify key factors contributing to contract cancellations and provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn rates.

### Key Business Questions:
- What factors contribute to customer churn?
- Are specific demographics more likely to cancel their contracts?
- How do contract length, payment methods, and monthly charges influence churn rates?
- What is the impact of customer service interactions on churn behaviour?

## 📂 Dataset Information
- Customer attributes: age, gender, subscription type, monthly charges.
- Behavioural factors: number of service calls, contract length, payment methods.
- Churn Indicator: whether the customer left the service (1 = Churn, 0 = Retained).
